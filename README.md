# TDD Basics
Let's take our first steps in Test Driven Development with JavaScript.

## Setup
First, make sure you have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm (comes with nodejs) installed.

```
❯ node --version
v13.11.0

❯ npm --version
6.14.7
```

Then install this project's dependencies with npm
```
❯ npm install
